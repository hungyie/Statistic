As a data driven person and Ex advance math tutor, I firmly believe that a solid grasp of statistics is a pivotal factor in becoming a proficient data scientist. Consequently, I aim to compile a repository of valuable data science/statistic articles, enriched with my personal understanding on when and how to apply the concepts effectively during my analysis.ðŸ‘¾
