# Statistic
As the field of data science continues to advance with the development of more state-of-the-art algorithms, many individuals find themselves losing their way. Often, people utilize various models without a basic understanding of their underlying principles.

Furthermore, I've observed that individuals from diverse backgrounds, including Finance, Computer Science, and Business, sometimes identify themselves as 'Data Analysts/Data Scientist' despite lacking knowledge of fundamental concepts in statistic.

As a data driven person and Ex advance math tutor, I firmly believe that a solid grasp of statistics is a pivotal factor in becoming a proficient data scientist. This repository serves as my personal revision tool, and I hope that a strong statistical foundation will not only guide me toward my goals but also uncover valuable business insights that may elude others.
